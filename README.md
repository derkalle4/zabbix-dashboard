# Zabbix Status Dashboard

This project is a single-page application built with SolidJS that displays groups and entries for each host monitored by Zabbix. It utilizes Bootstrap 5 for styling and provides a clean and responsive user interface.

This is work in progress and not suitable for broader adoption - for an working example please check https://status.kandru.de :)

# Development

After setting up the project, you can run the development server with:
```
npm install -D vite
npm run dev
```

This will start the application, and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
